# Graft 🚀

**Graft** is a powerful, interactive CLI tool designed to simplify the deployment and management of Docker-based projects on remote Linux servers. It bridges the gap between local development and remote production by providing a seamless synchronization and management experience.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Instant Sync**: Deploy your local code to a remote server with `graft sync`. Supports rsync for speed and Git for version-specific deployments.
- **Project Contexts**: Jump between projects anywhere on your machine using `graft -p <name>`.
- **Infrastructure on Demand**: Quickly initialize shared Postgres or Redis instances with `graft db init` or `graft redis init`.
- **Remote Project Registry**: Keep track of all your projects on the server with automated remote registration and conflict detection.
- **Registry Management**: Manage multiple servers in a global registry (`graft registry ls/add/del`).
- **Shell Access**: Direct interactive SSH sessions or non-interactive command execution via `graft -sh`.
- **Project Pulling**: "Clone" a project from a remote server to any local machine using `graft pull`.

## 🛠️ Installation & Build

### Prerequisites
- **Go**: Version 1.24+ recommended.
- **Rsync**: Required for fast file synchronization.
- **SSH**: Access to your target Linux server with key-based authentication.
